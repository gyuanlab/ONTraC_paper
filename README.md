## Abstract

Recent technological developments have made it possible to map the spatial organization of a tissue at the single-cell resolution. However, computational methods for analyzing spatially continuous variations of the tissue microenvironment are still lacking. Here we present ONTraC as a strategy that constructs spatial trajectories at the niche-level using a graph neural network-based modeling framework. Our benchmark analysis shows that ONTraC performs more favorably than existing methods for reconstructing spatial trajectories. Applications of ONTraC in real datasets show that it can successfully recapitulate the underlying anatomical structure, and further enable the identification of tissue microenvironment-dependent changes in cell states, gene regulatory networks, and cell-cell interaction activities within the same cell type. Taken together, ONTraC provides a useful and generally applicable tool for the systematic characterization of the structural and functional organization of the tissue microenvironment.
